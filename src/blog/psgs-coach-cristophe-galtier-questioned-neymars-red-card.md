Neymar JR receives two yellow cards and is sent off. PSG coach Christophe Gaultier has raised the question of whether the second one was awarded for diving, but whether the first one went a little too far and the referee didn't see Neymar JR fouling too many times before.

Here's what the PSC coach said after the match:

> #### **“As much as I can understand the simulation, he deserves the yellow \[card], a few minutes before he suffers a bad foul and his first yellow is very severe compared to the number of fouls suffered by Ney,”**
