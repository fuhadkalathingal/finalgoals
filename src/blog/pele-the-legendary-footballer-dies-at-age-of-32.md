***Pele***, the iconic **Brazilian** footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and the only player to have won the ***FIFA World Cup*** thrice, died at the age of **82** late last night. He had been battling ***colon cancer*** and was admitted in a hospital on November 29. He cheered for the Brazilian team during the recently conducted FIFA World cup 2022 in Qatar from the hospital bed. 

***Edson Arantes do Nascimento,*** popularly known as **Pele,** was born on **October 23,1940** at  **Tres *Coracoes*,** in the **Brazilian** state of  **Minas Gerais.** Still a teenager,  **Pele** fired in a hat-trick in the semi final[](https://sports.ndtv.com/football/pele-diego-maradona-lionel-messi-who-is-the-greatest-of-all-time-3649460) against **France** and followed it up with a brace in the final against Sweden to help the ***Selecao*win** the first of their record five world titles.

H﻿e was a part of the team again that defended the title in 1962, before adding a third **World Cup** to his name in 1970, when Brazil famously defeated **Italy** in the final in what was the first football **World** **Cup** to be televised in colour. He  scored 12 goals in his **World Cup** career, that included a total of four tournaments.

***Pele*** breathed his last following **colon cancer**, for which he was undergoing **chemotherapy**. However, he stopped responding to **chemotherapy** and was shifted to palliative care. Pele had a **tumour** removed from his **colon** in 2021 and was taking **chemotherapy** ever since.

The Brazilian football player, also termed '**The** **Greatest**' by FIFA, had been married thrice. He had a total of 7 children.
