PSG is facing Strasbourg in League One today. It will be their first League One match since the World Cup.

It is still unclear whether superstar Mpappe will play in the squad. But he is training well with the team.

Here's what coach Christophe Gaultier had to say about Mpapa at the pre-match press conference yesterday:

#### **"﻿Kylian has had a great World Cup. This return is also a strong signal to everyone. He is a player that could have been disappointed to not lift the most beautiful of trophies, even if he was the top scorer in the World Cup."**

He says Mbappe's performance at the World Cup was brilliant. Mbappe came to the club immediately after the World Cup, Achraf Hakimi did the same.

Neymar has since joined the team. Now Lionel Messi is also left to join. Coach Christopher Gaultier says that he will join the team soon.
