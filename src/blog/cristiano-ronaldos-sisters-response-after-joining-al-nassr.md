Now Cristiano Ronaldo has joined Saudi Arabian club Al Nasr.

At this point, Cristiano's two sisters reacted as follows:

**K﻿atia Aveiro :** 

> ***"﻿proud of my life. making history once again"***

**E﻿lma Aveiro :**

> ***"﻿Congratulations my king. God knows everything and can do everything. And we are with you always. Because you are the king"***

Fans may be debating whether Christiano's move to a Saudi Arabian club was right or wrong, but it was a historic moment in Asian football.
