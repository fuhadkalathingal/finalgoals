Fans are looking forward to which club Cristiano Ronaldo will join next. The fans are not ready to believe when the report of him approaching Saudi club Al Nasr comes out, but the fans are hoping that their superstar Cristiano Ronaldo will play in Europe's top five league anyway.

But now such transfer rumors are yet to come. Let's wait and see if there are new transfer rumors when the January transfer window opens.

 It is true that Al Nasr has made a huge offer for the star. But Christiano has not made a final decision regarding it and al nasar is moving ahead with it. Even Ronaldo's medical schedule is done.

Al Nasr are looking to complete the signing of Cristiano by the time the January transfer window opens. But so far no report has been received from Cristiano Ronaldo.
