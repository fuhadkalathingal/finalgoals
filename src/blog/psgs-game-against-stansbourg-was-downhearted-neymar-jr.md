Neymar joined French club PSG with high hopes after a disappointing exit at the World Cup.

He was very eager and looking forward to play the first match.

But we saw that match turn into a disaster for Neymar JR.

PSG won 2-1 against Strasbourg and Neymar had an assist for JR.

But he was sent off after receiving two yellow cards within two minutes of the match.

We should also note that the second yellow card was received when he dived.

Neymar had a great performance in the first half, but he had to be sent off in the second half after receiving a red card.

It's a very disappointing situation and he will have to be out for the next game so Neymar JR was very angry after receiving the red card and he left the PSG ground before the game ended.

This comes as a disappointing news among fans of Neymar JR.
